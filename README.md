# Coulomb
A multi-body dynamics code based on the Coulomb interaction

This code is intended for medium-scale Monte-Carlo simulations of the many-body problem. An arbitrary amount of ions with user-defined charge and mass move according to their mutual Coulomb forces. The program is designed multi-threaded to increase the amount of produced data.
Outputs are highly flexible, from individual particle trajectories and velocities to energy and density histograms.
